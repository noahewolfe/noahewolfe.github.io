Core-collapse supernovae are the violent deaths of massive stars; when a star runs out of nuclear fuel, it implodes, with the innermost regions falling onto a dense iron core in the center. Eventually, this compacts the core into a neutron star-- an exotic type of object whose physics aren't entirely understood. Sometimes, the rest of the stellar material will get launched outward as a shockwave, blowing up the rest of the star in a supernova that can be observed from Earth; other times, this material collapses the neutron star further into a black hole. 

Supernovae are some of the most extreme astrophysical phenomena in the universe, involving many different kinds of physics; as such, they are unique physical laboratories. With Professor Carla Fr√∂hlich at North Carolina State University, I studied the observable consequences of input stellar and nuclear physics on core-collapse.
