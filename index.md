## About Me

I am an incoming Ph.D. student in Physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where I will work in the LIGO Astrophysics Laboratory under [Professor Salvatore Vitale](https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/salvatore-vitale/){:target="_blank"} beginning in September 2022. At MIT, I will be supported by a [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship](https://physics.sciences.ncsu.edu/2022/04/19/university-fellowships-office-announces-nsf-graduate-research-fellowship-program-awards/){:target="_blank"}.

Broadly, I am interested in **gravitational-wave astrophysics**; I seek to understand what gravitational-wave signals can tell us about the physics of the Universe. Recently, I have helped develop advanced **parameter estimation** techniques for conducting phenomenological **tests of general relativity** with gravitational waves.

I earned Bachelors of Science degrees in Physics and Mathematics
at North Carolina State University, where I studied core-collapse supernovae 
under [Professor Carla Fr√∂hlich](http://astro.physics.ncsu.edu/~cfrohli/){:target="_blank"}.
