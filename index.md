## About Me

I am an incoming Ph.D. student in Physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where I will work in the LIGO Astrophysics Laboratory under [Professor Salvatore Vitale](https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/salvatore-vitale/) beginning  in September 2020. At MIT, I will be supported by a [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship](https://physics.sciences.ncsu.edu/2022/04/19/university-fellowships-office-announces-nsf-graduate-research-fellowship-program-awards/).

I earned Bachelors of Science degrees in Physics and Mathematics
at North Carolina State University, where I studied core-collapse supernovae 
under [Professor Carla Fröhlich](http://astro.physics.ncsu.edu/~cfrohli/).
